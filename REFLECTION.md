# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
The `document.getElementById` code was similar to what we've been practicing over the weeks in html so it helped me the most.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I just followed instructions in the assignment and used the suggested ones.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
When I was debugging and adding some of my creative ideas I thought I broke something in tge code because my changes weren't showing up so I had to read very line to make sure I was right and then tested the code in VSC and it worked instantly with a live server. When I commit the html it takes a while to upload the new code so that's why I thought I broke it.

## What personal twist did you add?
I used the ⭐️ emoji instead of cookies and called it “Star Clicker”. I also had the background change for every milestone.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Mobile games use this kind of interactions to track progress and reward users at milestones.
